Walras

This game illustrates Walrasion equilibrium in a pure consumption market. Users can choose the number of market agents, who all have homogeneous degree 0 Cobb-Douglas preferences.  Each agent is randomly allocated an endowment of the two goods.  The user can then specify a price vector and the model then calculates the excess demand of the two goods.

The command "excessdemand()" executes the model.
